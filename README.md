## Clustering System

### Overview
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and other machine learning models to identify clusters in diverse datasets from uploaded CSV and XLSX files. The system clusters similar items within the data without assigning predefined categories to these clusters. FastAPI is used to handle API requests robustly, and LangChain is integrated to enhance data analysis with the capabilities of LLMs.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for serving the application)
- LangChain
- pandas (for file handling)
- Unstructured [all-docs]
- Any necessary machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-project-directory]

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain tensorflow pandas openpyxl
```

### Usage
To run the application:
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will serve the API on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /upload-file**: Accepts file uploads in CSV or XLSX format and returns clusters based on identified patterns.

### File Uploads
Use the `/upload-file` endpoint to upload your data files. The endpoint expects files in either CSV or XLSX format. Ensure that your files are formatted correctly with headers that describe each column of data.

### Developing with LangChain
LangChain is utilized to leverage LLMs for analyzing and clustering data based on the features extracted from the uploaded files. Ensure your LangChain configurations are set correctly to interface with your chosen LLM provider.

### Deployment
For production deployment, use a production-ready server like Gunicorn, and ensure you have proper logging, monitoring, and security configurations in place.
